  %p
    This time we are looking to hire experienced Ruby programmers. Our ideal candidate has <b>more
    than 2 years experience</b>, but some programmers become really good even before that.
    We'll consider their Github points (a nice indicator of a good programmer), and even if they are not experienced,
    candidates with <b>500 Github points or more</b> can apply. And there is one more catch:
    Ruby being a cool and awesome language, a lot of smart youngsters are very good at it. We love those kids,
    but for this particular job we'd rather have them study at school than work. Let us filter out candidates who
    are <b>younger than 15</b>. Not to get carried away, the earlier requirement of not considering <b>candidates who applied recently</b>
    also holds here.

    If you haven't solved these types of expressions before, try getting one condition right at a time. For each condition
    you get correct, some tests will start passing. As your expression matures to take care of all the criteria, all the tests will pass
    and you'll have a green flag. Now, march on!

      1. Use parantheses generously. If you start your expression with a 'not' operator, wrap everything inside a parantheses. <br/>
      2. You can have 2 or more years of experience, or  >= 500 Github points, or both. <br/>
